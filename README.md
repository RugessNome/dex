# `Dex` - a language-agnostic documentation system

> Wellll, whadya know !

`Dex` aims at providing a simple yet powerful tool to create documentation using a 
`TeX`-like language and exporting it to multiple formats.

Unlike many other documentation tools, `DeX` does not assume anything about 
the language you are working with. 
In fact, it only recognizes its own built-in `TeX`-like language; meaning that 
`DeX` can be used to generate documentation for non-programming projects.

**Warning:** Development is at a very early stage; things are not stable and many features 
are lacking. For example, only one export format is currently supported (Markdown).
